    excerpt: "Over the last 2-3 years, in my free time, I've been lerning web and mobile development online. During that time, I've created several projects that live either on my computer, online, or both. These include projects made to solve a problem I encountered while working (for both past and current employers), tutorials I've followed while learning something new, and projects I'm passionate about. However, I've never really created a service or an API that is open to the public for use, and/or haven't created any open source projects myself. So, I wanted to give this a shot.",
