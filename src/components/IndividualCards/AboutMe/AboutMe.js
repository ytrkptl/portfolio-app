        I am a math teacher from Virginia, United States. In my free time, I
        love to code and work on developing apps and websites. I also like to
        create lessons and sell them online for teachers to buy.

              My first exposure to programming was in college when I learned its
              basics using QBasic, Visual Basic, Mathematica, and Maple. At that
              time, I was planning to become a math teacher and had no idea
              about what I was learning. After graduating from college and
              teaching for a year, I felt as if something was missing. It was
              then that I came across online platforms like Khan Academy, where
              I started to learn JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p className="aboutMePara1">
              Learning on platforms like Khan Academy did not prepare me for any
              official jobs though. Hence, over the next four years, I continued
              to teach as my primary job and dived deeper into programming in my
              free time. I still did not feel quite ready for developing though.
              Fortunately, however, in December of 2018, I applied and gained a
              scholarship from Google in partnership with Udacity. It was called
              Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship and allowed me to select a
              field of learning. At that time, I chose to learn Android
              Development.
            </p>
            <p className="aboutMePara1">
              Taking the Android course from above exposed me to many developer
              tools, languages, frameworks, Integrated Development Environments,
              etc. It prepared me to build real projects from scratch all the
              way up to learning advanced concepts such as working with
              databases, APIs, etc. To supplement this, I took courses from
              Udemy, which exposed me to building games in Android, implementing
              authentication, syncing data in real-time, storing data in the
              cloud, setting up SSH, and so much more.
            </p>
            <p className="aboutMePara1">
              The skills gained above did not feel enough, so I thought of
              taking a different route. Earlier in 2019, I started learning web
              development by taking some online courses, and I cannot imagine
              how much I have learned ever since. Now, Iâ€™ve experienced and am
              pretty good at setting up and running servers, building REST APIs,
              using Docker, Redis, setting up authentication, following best
              practices for storing data, understanding Data Structures and
              Algorithms (currently learning more about it), using React, Redux,
              Redux-Saga, SASS, styled-components, optimizing apps using
              code-splitting, lazy loading, dynamic imports, storing data in
              POSTGRES, Firebase Storage, MongoDB, etc.

              All this sounds fancy, but to see it for yourself, you should
              check out my projects included in this site. Apart from this, I
              sell math lessons online and have occasionally made math YouTube
              videos when needed. These skills can be easily brought over to
              development as well. I have also been enrolled in a Master of
              Science degree at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, and
              have taken a Cryptology, and a Graph Theory course in the past.
              However, due to the cost of education, I had to stop taking
              further courses with them.
