      'Looking for some feedback on this Avatar-letter project I thought of sharing months ago',
    excerpt:
      "Over the last 2-3 years, in my free time, I've been lerning web and mobile development online. During that time, I've created several projects that live either on my computer, online, or both. These include projects made to solve a problem I encountered while working (for both past and current employers), tutorials I've followed while learning something new, and projects I'm passionate about. However, I've never really created a service or an API that is open to the public for use, and/or haven't created any open source projects myself. So, I wanted to give this a shot.",

    excerpt: `I have been wanting to share this for a while now. I must do it now. Waiting longer or waiting till it is nearly perfect might be a mistake, especially in this tech industry anyways. So let me just go ahead and share what I currently have via the CodePen link found in this blog. There is probably a lot that can be improved but hey, I am just doing this for fun!`,
